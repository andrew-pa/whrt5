An adventure in raytracing 3D animations and generally avoiding pathtracing

To build, clone Ogg and Theora in depd/, then build them with the provided VS solution files, static builds. 
Additionally requires GLM somewhere, right now pointed at my clone of andrew-pa/plutracer but generally anywhere will work
